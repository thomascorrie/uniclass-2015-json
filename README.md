# uniclass-2015-json
Uniclass 2015 classification tables reformatted in [JSON](http://www.json.org/). Similar to the [csv version by buildig](https://github.com/buildig/uniclass-2015) I have converted the tables and packaged as a [versioned snapshot](https://github.com/thomascorrie/uniclass-2015-json/releases).

The tables are published by the [NBS](https://toolkit.thenbs.com/articles/classification#classificationtables)

One use is to visualize the tables in a collapsible tree structure to assist in understanding the classification hierarchy:
* All tables can be seen on [gist](https://gist.github.com/thomascorrie/4d688cd9b6bb73d50fcc019f6680d6e6) and [bl.ocks](https://bl.ocks.org/thomascorrie/4d688cd9b6bb73d50fcc019f6680d6e6)
* A more experimental draggable version of just the Ss Systems table can be seen on [gist](https://gist.github.com/thomascorrie/799044318893cbdcfe04b73b9cb8fa49) and [bl.ocks](https://bl.ocks.org/thomascorrie/799044318893cbdcfe04b73b9cb8fa49)
